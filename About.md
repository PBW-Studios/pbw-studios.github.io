# The Team

## The Waffle
Our programmer - codename "waffle" - helps us run all our tech (including this site) and builds the structure of our games. He is also very cool and handsome and is the coolest. Very cool.

## The Peanut Butter
Our art team - codename "peanut butter" - make amazing concept art, and then turns it into stunning pixelart for our games. Without them the waffle would be bland, tasteless, and consist of lots of gray squares. They provide the flavor, beauty, and style that our games deserve, and desperately need.

## The Syrup
Our sound team - codename "syrup" - take our tasty, peanut butter waffle, and bring it up to the next level. They are our cherry on top, the cream of the crop, and that extra shine that elevates our games into what we all hope them to be.

## Instructions on the back box
Our writing team - codename "instructions on the back of the box" - help to guide the rest of the team by building awesome worlds, interesting characters, and thrilling stories for us to build our games around. They also make great codenames for everyone but themselves.
